## Repository Introduction

‌[SMC++‌](https://github.com/popgenmethods/smcpp) is a tool that utilizes whole-genome data from multiple samples to infer population size history with high precision. Due to its ability to handle multiple samples and low-coverage data, it has become one of the standard tools in contemporary population genetics research.

**Core Features:**

By jointly analyzing whole-genome samples from multiple populations, it infers the population size history and divergence times of different populations.

This project offers pre-configured [**SMC++ Population Size History Estimate Program**]() images with SMC++ and its runtime environment pre-installed, along with deployment templates. Follow the guide to enjoy an "out-of-the-box" experience.

> **System Requirements:**
>
> - CPU: 2GHz or higher
> - RAM: 8GB or more
> - Disk: At least 40GB
